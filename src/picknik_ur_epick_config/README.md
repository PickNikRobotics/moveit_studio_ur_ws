# picknik_ur_epick_config

This is a MoveIt Pro configuration for a pick-and-place workcell which uses a Universal Robot arm and Robotiq E-Pick gripper.

The "Looping Pick and Place Object SAM" objective provides a reference application on how to interface with an external 2D segmentation server to label object instances for bin picking applications.
