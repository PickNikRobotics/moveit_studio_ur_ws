# MoveIt Studio Workspace

This is a sample user workspace for running MoveIt Studio with a generic Universal Robots (UR) arm.
For more information, refer to the [MoveIt Studio Documentation](https://docs.picknik.ai/).

Instructions for building your own MoveIt Studio configuration can be found [in the getting started guides.](https://docs.picknik.ai/en/stable/getting_started/getting_started.html)

MoveIt Studio can be used with real robots and full simulators such as Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
For testing purposes, you can also use the [ROS 2 Control Mock Components](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/ros2_control/hardware_interface/doc/mock_components_userdoc.html), which is what this repo is configured to use.

This workspace offers a reasonable starting point for those users looking to develop with MoveIt Studio using custom base and site configurations.
For more information refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.picknik.ai/en/stable/).
